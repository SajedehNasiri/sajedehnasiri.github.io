          <p class="pb8">Designing a website for a local greenhouse was one of the student assignment we had in
            UX-Land
            school.
            In a team of four, we were assigned to design an <span class="bold">adaptive website</span> for both
            <span class="bold">mobile</span> and <span class="bold">desktop devices</span>
            focusing on <span class="bold">User Interface</span> aspect.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We defined <span class="bold">Leafy</span> as an online store, in which using <span class="bold">Plant
              Finder</span> can suggest the right plant based on the
            users’ need.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As this is a <span class="bold">school concept project</span>, we defined a <span class="bold">hypothetical
              stakeholder</span> at the beginning and consider
            his requirements and limitations throughout the process.

              By analyzing the information we obtained through surveys and interviews, we realized the problem most
              users

            Instead of boxing everything, the entire space was used. As the result, bigger images were used hence the

              <p>Making a good balance of users' needs and stakeholders' marketing strategy in mind while designing.</p>

              <p>My first student project exposed me to the importance of understanding users' needs at every stage of
                the design process. The best way to gain this overview is by keeping track of all research findings and
                referring to them continually.</p>

              <p>It was interesting to discover that I enjoyed interaction design the most, and I'll continue to develop
                this skill in the next projects.</p>

          <p>We are planning to add a section where a user can see the selected plant in a specific part of his/her
            space, as well as some interior design tips. The need for the same was initiated in the early stages of the
            project when we were interviewing with our potential users.
            However because of the nature of this project, we were to focus on one task mainly.
            Hence this will be the second phase of the project. </p>
